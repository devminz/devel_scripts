`make_gitignore.py` generates gitignore file  based on command line arguments. 
The following command appends `.gitgnore` with `Vim`, `Emacs` and `Linux` sections
as per the gitignore repo's ignore files. The path to `gitignore repo` has to be configured 
in `config.py` 


```bash 
python3  make_gitignore Vim Emacs Linux 
```
